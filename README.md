# Java-Projects-II
A collection of the most advanced Software II (OSU) projects I've completed using the Java programming language. For my earlier projects, please view the Java-Projects-I repository. These projects are mainly intended for viewing purposes. Those who want to test the code (such as recruiters), can simply download the files and run the java programs in their Eclipse application.


Project Descriptions:

BLParser - a Java project that completes and carefully tests an implementation of a recursive-descent parser for the BL language. This is a fundamental piece of the BL compiler. The parser follows the context-free grammar (CFG) for the BL language.

ListWithRetreat - a Java project that completes and carefully tests implementations of the constructor and all kernel methods defined in interface ListKernel plus the methods retreat and moveToFinish defined in interface List, by building a representation that involves a doubly-linked list of nodes using Java references.

MapWithHashing - a Java project that completes and carefully tests implementations of all the constructors and kernel methods defined in interface MapKernel, and builds the data structure representing a Map object by layering it on top of an array of Map itself. The algorithmic approach is summarized as utilizing hashing to immediately narrow every search to a much smaller Map.

NaturalNumberOnString - a Java project that completes and carefully tests implementations of all the constructors and kernel methods defined in interface NaturalNumberKernel, and builds the data structure representing a NaturalNumber object by layering it on top of java.lang.String.

ProgramAndStatement - a Java project that completes and carefully tests implementations of the constructor and kernel methods defined in interfaces ProgramKernel and StatementKernel. These are the core components in the BL compiler. 

SetOnBST - a Java project that completes and carefully tests implementations of the constructor and all kernel methods defined in interface SetKernel, and builds the data structure representing a Set object by layering it on top of BinaryTree. The algorithmic approach is summarized as utilizing a binary search tree to reduce search time from linear to logarithmic in the number of elements in the set.

SortingMachineWithHeapsort - a Java project that completes and carefully tests implementations of the constructor and all kernel methods defined in interface SortingMachineKernel, and builds the data structure representing a SortingMachine object by layering it on top of Queue and arrays.

TagCloud2 - a Java program that generates a tag cloud from a given input text.

TagCloudGenerator -  a Java program that generates a tag cloud from a given input text using only components from the standard Java libraries.

WordCounter - a Java program that counts word occurrences in a given input file and outputs an HTML document with a table of the words and counts listed in alphabetical order.
